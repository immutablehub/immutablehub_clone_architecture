## History Bundles & Clone Mechanism

" The repository is cloned via Git bundles, which encapsulate granular commit data into cryptographically sealed History Bundles.
When a developer executes ihub op clone <reponame>, these bundles are retrieved to reconstruct the local environment, creating an unalterable audit trail from the very first commit.
