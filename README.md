ARCHITECTURE OF CLONE ON IMMUTABLEHUB

[how does clone work on immutablehub]

> Immutable is fully compatible with standard Git work flows. Developers continue using git commit exactly as they do today ,no new commands, no protocol changes, and no workflow migration required. Immutable integrates seamlessly into existing repositories without disrupting how teams already build and collaborate.

## Clone Mechanism
> Unlike traditional centralized platforms, the repository is cloned via Git Bundles. By utilizing the git clone command against these decentralized bundles, the system ensures that the full historical state is reconstructed perfectly on the local machine.
